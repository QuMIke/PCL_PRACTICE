This tutorial will teach you how to write an interactive ICP viewer.
The program will load a point cloud and apply a rigid transformation on it.
After that the ICP algorithm will align the transformed point cloud with the original. 
Each time the user presses “space” an ICP iteration is done and the viewer is refreshed.
