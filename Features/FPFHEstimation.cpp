/*
For real-time or near real-time applications, the computation of 
Point Feature Histograms in dense point neighborhoods can represent one of the major bottlenecks.
This tutorial describes a simplification of the PFH formulation, 
called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), that reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm to O(nk), 
while still retaining most of the discriminative power of the PFH.
