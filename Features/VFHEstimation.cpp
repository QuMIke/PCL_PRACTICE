/*
This document describes the Viewpoint Feature Histogram ([VFH]) descriptor, 
a novel representation for point clusters for the problem of Cluster (e.g., Object) Recognition and 6DOF Pose Estimation.
The Viewpoint Feature Histogram (or VFH) has its roots in the FPFH descriptor (see Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH) descriptors).
Due to its speed and discriminative power, we decided to leverage the strong recognition results of FPFH, 
but to add in viewpoint variance while retaining invariance to scale.
